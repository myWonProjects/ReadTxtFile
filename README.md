# ReadTxtFile


With this project, we can read any txt extension file and and print all lines in the file. For this we use "ReadAllLines" method and all lines we read put in an array. But we also want to insert a line that we define a string value in advance, so we are able to do this with if block and "Equals" method. 
We made this in try-catch block, in this way we can debug more easily and also the message we want to will be displayed regardless of error type.

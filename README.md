# ReadTxtFile


With this project, we can read any txt extension file and and print all lines in the file. But we also want to insert a line that we define a string value in advance, so we are able to do this with if block and "Equals" method.
We made this in try-catch block, in this way we can debug more easily and also the message we want to will be displayed regardless of error type.
